        Once upon a time there was a young rabbit named Robert. Robert lived in a very nice home with a loving family and never wanted for anything, but he was uphappy and didn't know why. One day Robert was frolicking in the garden with his favorite toy when he spotted that the little hole in the fence, that had always previously been covered with a rock, was now open to the world. Robert was afraid of the hole, but curious, too, like the world was wide open and waiting for him.
