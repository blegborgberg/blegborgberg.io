        There's no going back now. Robert screws up his nose, makes a little huff, and for the first time in his life, begins to dig. 
        <br>
        Turns out this digging business is dirty work, but Robert keeps going. He digs and digs and the scent of earth and that lovely outside smell he smelled through the fence spur him on until at last he looks up. The whole world is in front of him! Robert looks out across an open field in front of him and suddenly wants more than anything to bolt, to stretch his legs under him and be a real rabbit... but... Robert looks back at the hole in the fence and the house beyond, and he wonders about his people. Can he just leave?
